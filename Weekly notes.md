# Weekly notes

- Periodic notes help to write diaries, work logs, todos, etc.
  - daily notes
  - weekly notes
  - monthly notes
- I personally prefer granularity of weekly notes over daily notes.
- *Periodic notes* plug-in helps.

## Examples

- [[2023-W02]]
- Creating a new weekly note using [[weekly template]] which requires the *Templater* plug-in.
  - ==> **Demo**: create a new weekly note using a command.
