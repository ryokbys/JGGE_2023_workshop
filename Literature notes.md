# Literature notes

- Important to organize journal papers you have read or should be cited in your manuscript.
- Reference manager apps or services:
  - Zotero
  - Mendeley
  - Paperpile
- An Obsidian community plug-in helps:
  - Paperpile can automatically export whole data to a BibTex file.
  - Obsidian can look for a paper and create a literature note.
  - ==> Demo: create a literature note for a paper by A. Einstein ğŸ˜‰
