# Literature notes

- Important to organize journal papers you have read or should be cited in your manuscript.
- Reference manager apps or services:
  - Zotero
  - Mendeley
  - Paperpile
- An Obsidian community plug-in (*Citations*) helps:
  - ![[230224_literature-note_workflow.jpeg|600]]
  - [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com) can automatically export whole database to a local BibTex file.
  - The *Citation* plug-in helps looking for literature info and creates a literature note. (There seems some bugs in the plug-in, though...)
  - ==> **Demo**: create a literature note for the paper of $E=mc^2$ by A. Einstein.
