# Literature notes

- Important to organize journal papers you have read or should be cited in your manuscript.
- Reference manager apps or services:
  - Zotero
  - Mendeley
  - Paperpile
- An Obsidian community plug-in (*Citations*) helps:
  - ![[230224_literature-note_workflow.jpeg|600]]
  - [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com) can automatically export whole database to a local BibTex file.
  - The *Citation* plug-in helps looking for literature info and creates a literature note.
  - ==> Demo: create a literature note for a paper by A. Einstein of $E=mc^2$.
